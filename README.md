# Coppell For Youth

We are Coppell For Youth, a nonprofit focusing on the wellbeing of the youth across the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex. From being inspired by the recent pandemic, we realized how many families were being affected by this situation and ultimately realized our purpose. Our objective is to spread positivity and strength among youth in our community. We chose children’s health specifically as the youth are the leaders of tomorrow, so their wellbeing matters the most. Everyone feels isolated in these difficult times, but this pandemic has most significantly affected children. As you already know, kids love to play around and have fun and not being able to do so has negatively impacted children’s mental health and behavior. We hope to bring joy to their day by endeavoring in projects which offer encouragement to help pave their path for success.
