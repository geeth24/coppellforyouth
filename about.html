                    <p>We are Coppell For Youth, a nonprofit focusing on the wellbeing of the youth across the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex. From being inspired by the recent pandemic, we realized how many families were being affected by this situation and ultimately realized our purpose. Our objective is to spread positivity and strength among youth in our community. We chose children’s health specifically as the youth are the leaders of tomorrow, so their wellbeing matters the most. Everyone feels isolated in these difficult times, but this pandemic has most significantly affected children. As you already know, kids love to play around and have fun and not being able to do so has negatively impacted children’s mental health and behavior. We hope to bring joy to their day by endeavoring in projects which offer encouragement to help pave their path for success.<br></p>

                        <h1>OUR STORY<br></h1>
                        <p><br>We’ve all been together in a team for the past few years participating in Destination Imagination. Once we came to high school we wanted to offer something bigger for our community, an organization that could inspire youth and spread positivity. We were looking at different ways on how this can be persuaded and then the pandemic came around and we realized how many families were being affected by this situation and we ultimately realized our purpose. We chose to utilize this situation to do good.​<br><br>Our hardworking team consists of Maya Palavali, Meghana Ambati, Ananya Adiki, Apurva Betgar, and Anusha Patel. We strive to help inspire children, be the best version of themselves, and work hard to achieve their goal. Coppell For Youth is a symbol of hope and security to everyone.
